# Final Assignment & Prensentation Due: Data Visualization, Analysis & Work Process

Similar to Assignment 2, only for your final assignment you'll need to find your own data that is of interest. You can combine this with the Congressional data we've been working with, but you need to use at least 1 additional data source that you find.

Use techniques that we've been practicing in class to combine data sets, break apart fields, and do the data cleaning work necessary to create one or more visualizations using the data sets.

Write up your process, data cleaning methods, visualization methods and overall analysis. Below are some questions to help guide you.

1. Describe your analysis. What was the question you sought to answer? What data did you acquire to answer it? Where did you find the data?
2. Describe the data. What is the data you chose to work with? What type of variables are used in the visualization? Is the information qualitative or quantitative? What methods did you use to clean up the data to visualize it? 
3. Describe the visualization techniques. How is the data visualized? What technique is in use (e.g. what type of chart(s)? how is the data encoded? how is color being used?) Why did you choose this visualization technique? What it is communicating? What story is it telling? 
4. What would be your next set of questions? Is there other data that would contribute to the analysis?

You will present your data analysis and visualization in class and submit your write up after receiving feedback from the class in final presentations.
