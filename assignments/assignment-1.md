# Assignment 1: Analysis of a Visualization

This is an exercise to practice critically analyzing existing data visualizations to learn about what works, what doesn't work, and be able to think about what could be done differently. 

Pick a data visualization that is interesting to you (could be from the news, a report that you are reading, or anything really), and answer the following questions:

1) Describe the visualization's purpose. What did you learn from it? What it is communicating? What story is it telling?
2) Describe the data. What is the data? What type of variables are used in the visualization? Is the information qualitative or quantitative? Where did it come from? What can you tell about how the data was collected or the context the data is from? What is the sample size? What is the population?
3) Describe the visualization techniques. How is the data visualized? What technique is in use (e.g. what type of chart(s)? how is the data encoded? how is color being used? is it interactive?)
4) Is anything missing? 
5) What would be your next set of questions? Is there other data that would contribute to the analysis?
6) Brainstorm an alternative. How else could the data have been visualized or communicated?
