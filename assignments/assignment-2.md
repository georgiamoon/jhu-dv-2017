# Assignment 2: Visualize Data

This is an exercise to practice visualizing data that we've been working with for the last few weeks.

There are 3 data sets available for use:
- [Jan - Mar 2017 House Spending Data](assignment2data/house_JAN-MAR2017_DETAIL_ONLY.csv)
- [October 2016 - Mar 2017 Senate Spending Data](assignment2data/115sdoc2_senate_data_cleaned-combined.csv) -- This data was parsed on an experimental basis using code from the Sunlight Foundation for Senate disbursement reports. Please cite 'The Sunlight Foundation' in any usage. For more information see the readme at http://assets-reporting.s3.amazonaws.com/1.0/senate_disbursements/readme.txt.
- [Senate Member data](assignment2data/senate-propublica.csv)
- [House Member data](assignment2data/house-propublica.csv)

Use techniques that we've been practicing in class to combine data sets, break apart fields, and do the data cleaning work necessary to create one or more visualizations using the data sets.

1. Describe the visualization's purpose. Why did you choose this visualization technique? What it is communicating? What story is it telling?
2. Describe the visualization techniques. How is the data visualized? What technique is in use (e.g. what type of chart(s)? how is the data encoded? how is color being used?)
3. Describe the data. What is the data you chose to work with? What type of variables are used in the visualization? Is the information qualitative or quantitative? What methods did you use to clean up the data to visualize it?
4. What would be your next set of questions? Is there other data that would contribute to the analysis?
