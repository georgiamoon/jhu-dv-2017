## Assignments/Grading
This class will follow along the [Essential Statistics for Data Analysis using Excel course on EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/essential-statistics-data-analysis-using-microsoft-dat222x-1#!). There will be weekly exercises & video tutorials, which will have scored quizzes/assignments. We will also supplement with using some of the [MS PowerBI guided learning](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/guided-learning/), and continue building on skills from Part 1 of the course in Tableau.

*Note: No assignments will be accepted late, for any reason other than serious illness or family emergency. Since we are following an EdX course, falling behind in the weekly assignments will lead to not being able to complete the course.
